Howdy! It’s been a while, but I’ve finally created new site so I can post things I’ve been working on recently. There’s currently not much too it, it’s more a work in progress. It’s created from [Todd Motto’s HTML5 Blank][1] WordPress starter theme for developers—highly recommended to kick-start any theme.

Please excuse any odd ‘features’ that may appear whilst I iron out any bugs! That’s all for now, keep your eyes peeled for new features and updates.

<p>A new option has been introduced to allow easily setting an image, rather than resorting to CSS image replacement techniques. Some under the hood optimisations and tweaks have been made, too. <span class="milli">(Thanks to NickRameau for suggestions).</span></p>

## Using images
To use the new image feature simply add the following line to your settings (<a href="http://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/">see this post for how to install</a>): <code><span class="opt">scrollImg</span>: <span class="val">true</span>
</code> This will prevent any text set in <code>scollText</code> from being visible, allowing you to set a background image in your CSS file â€” no image replacement techniques needed to hide the the text. Any text set in <code>scrollText</code> will still be used as the link title.

### Example usage

<strong>JavaScript</strong>

{% highlight js %}
$.scrollUp({
  scrollImg: true
});
{% endhighlight %}

<strong>CSS</strong>

{% highlight css %}
#scrollUp {
  bottom: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  width: 38px; /* Width of image */
  height: 38px; /* Height of image */
  background: url(../../img/top.png) no-repeat;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include post-actions.html %}
